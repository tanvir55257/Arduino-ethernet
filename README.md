Code Snippet 1:
Purpose: This Arduino code enables an Arduino board with Ethernet capability to make periodic HTTP POST requests to a server (a Raspberry Pi running Node-RED) with simulated sensor data in JSON format.

Key Components:

Utilizes the Ethernet library for network communication.
Uses the ArduinoJson library for handling JSON data.
Sends a simulated sensor data JSON payload in an HTTP POST request to a specified server and resource.
Repeats the process in a loop, waiting for a minute between each request.
Note: Replace placeholders with actual values, such as the server IP address, port number, and resource endpoint.

Code Snippet 2:
Purpose: This Arduino code establishes an Ethernet connection and interacts with the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data. It specifically focuses on extracting temperature and humidity information from the API response.

Key Components:

Utilizes the Ethernet library for network communication.
Uses the ArduinoJson library for parsing JSON data.
Sends an HTTP GET request to the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather information.
Parses the JSON response to extract temperature and humidity data.
Prints the extracted data to the serial monitor.
Repeats the process in a loop, waiting for a minute between each request.
